**TASE**: *Text-Audio Sync Engine*
---

TASE is an engine contained within a framework designed to associate words in text with words in audio. The engine is under development and will be implemented in a web platform to synchronize text with audio for seamless switching between books and audiobooks.

# Requirements

TASE requires `ffmpeg`, `python3`, and `pip3`. Install the required Python dependencies with `pip3 install -r requirements-GPU.txt` if you intend to use TASE with GPU processing (recommended), or `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` if you intend to use TASE with CPU-only processing.
